# ESP32-AI-Cloud-Project
Overview
This project is an educational initiative designed to teach high school students how to build an IoT (Internet of Things) application using the ESP32 microcontroller, integrated with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cloud technologies. Students will collaborate through GitHub to manage their code, track progress, and complete a real-world IoT project while learning key technical skills.

Project Goals
IoT Development: Build an IoT application using the ESP32 to collect and process sensor data.
AI Integration: Apply AI algorithms to analyze the collected data and make intelligent decisions.
Cloud Connectivity: Utilize cloud services for data storage, monitoring, and remote control of the IoT system.
Collaboration: Teach students how to manage a project using GitHub's tools like issues, kanban boards, milestones, and version control.
Agile Development: Practice Scrum principles in real-world software development scenarios.
Features
Setup and configure the ESP32 microcontroller.
Collect data from sensors and send it to the cloud for analysis.
Use AI models for data prediction and decision-making.
Remote control of the IoT device through cloud dashboards.
Continuous project tracking using GitHub Projects for task management.
Tech Stack
Hardware: ESP32 Microcontroller
Software:
C/C++ for ESP32 programming
Python for AI model development
Cloud Services:
MQTT for message communication
Cloud services for data storage and remote management
Version Control & Project Management: GitHub
